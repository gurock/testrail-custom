# TestRail User-Submitted Language Translations

This section holds user-submitted TestRail translation files. To learn more about translating TestRail, please see the [Gurock website](http://docs.gurock.com/testrail-custom/lang-translation).

PLEASE NOTE: Custom Langauge files can only be used by teams who use TestRail Server (TestRail installed on local company servers). If your team uses TestRail Cloud (accessible on testrail.com, testrail.net, or testrail.io), then you will not be able to utilize these translations.

### General Guidelines
* Each language should be placed in its own directory.
* If there are any variables or values which should be updated prior to use, please clearly identify these within the script.
* Please do not publish any potentially sensitive information (API Tokens, User information, proprietary information, etc.).
* Please notify us if you identify any potentially malicious code anywhere in the repository.
* Any scripts provided shall not violate [TestRail Terms and Conditions](https://www.gurock.com/about/terms).

### Pull Requests
* When submitting a pull request to modify a script you did not write, please include a detailed comment and link(s) to any supporting documentation if necessary.

### Disclaimers
* Scripts provided may contain bugs, so are used at your own risk.
* Since the code and scripts available in this repository will be user-contributed, the TestRail support team may not be able to fully troubleshoot or help customize these.

### Contact Us
If you have any questions, or have a script to contribue which does not fall into any of the available categories, please send us an email here: [contact@gurock.com](mailto:contact@gurock.com)
