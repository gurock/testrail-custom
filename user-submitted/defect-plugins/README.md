# TestRail User-Submitted Defect Plugins

This section holds user-submitted TestRail Defect Plugins. To learn more about creating and using custom Defect Plugins, please see the [Gurock website](http://docs.gurock.com/testrail-integration/defects-plugins-custom).

PLEASE NOTE: Custom Defect Plugins can only be used by teams who use TestRail Server (TestRail installed on local company servers). If your team uses TestRail Cloud (accessible on testrail.com, testrail.net, or testrail.io), then you will not be able to utilize these custom plugins.

### General Guidelines
* Script names should identify the tool.
* Comments and descriptions inside any script should explain the script's functionality.
* If there are any variables or values which should be updated prior to use, please clearly identify these within the script.
* Please do not publish any potentially sensitive information (API Tokens, User information, proprietary information, etc.).
* Please notify us if you identify any potentially malicious code anywhere in the repository.
* Any scripts provided shall not violate [TestRail Terms and Conditions](https://www.gurock.com/about/terms).

### Pull Requests
* When submitting a pull request to modify a script you did not write, please include a detailed comment and link(s) to any supporting documentation if necessary.

### Disclaimers
* Scripts provided may contain bugs, so are used at your own risk.
